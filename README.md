# Widths

The Predix Experience Widths module is a simple file of helper classes to drop widths onto elements such as grid systems.

## Dependencies

Px's Spacing Responsive module depends on two other Px and inuitcss modules:

* [settings.defaults](https://github.com/inuitcss/settings.defaults)
* [px-functions-design](https://github.sw.ge.com/pxc/px-functions-design)

## Upstream dependency

The Widths module is also an upstream dependency for this module:

* [px-widths-responsive-design](https://github.sw.ge.com/pxc/px-widths-responsive-design)

## Installation

Install using Bower:

    bower install --save https://github.sw.ge.com/pxc/px-widths-design.git

Once installed, `@import` into your project's Sass file in its Trumps layer:

    @import "../px-spacing-responsive-design/trumps.widths";

See [px-getting-started](https://github.sw.ge.com/pxc/px-getting-started#a-note-about-relative-import-paths) for an explanation of the `../`

## Usage

Pxâ€™s widths classes are available in one of two formats. The default format is fraction-like, e.g.: `class="1/2"`.

The other available format is spoken-word, e.g. `class="one-half"`. Enable this by setting the `$inuit-use-fractions` flag to `true` prior to importing the module.
